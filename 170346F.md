1. **Smart Contract**

   Smart contracts are program pieces which are stored on a blockchain and run when predetermined conditions are fulfilled. They provide business logic for the blockchain network. Smart contracts are usually used to automate agreement execution and therefore the participants. In Hyperledger Fabric we can also use chaincode to specify assets and implement logic to manage them.


2. **Consensus**

   These are algorithms that help nodes in the Blockchain network come to an agreement on certain validation processes in a collection of transactions. To establish Consensus, a variety of Algorithms are available. As an example, Bitcoin, a well-known Blockchain user, uses the Proof-of-Work Algorithm.
